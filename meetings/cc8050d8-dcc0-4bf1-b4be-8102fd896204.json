Why?\nWell, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for a hike on Saturday.\nThat sounds great! I'm always up for a hike. Where were you thinking of going?\nI was planning on heading to the Bear Mountain State Park. The trails there are beautiful this time of year.\nOh, I love Bear Mountain! I haven't been there in ages.\nPerfect! We could leave around 8:00 AM to beat the crowd and enjoy the cool morning air.\nSounds good to me.
